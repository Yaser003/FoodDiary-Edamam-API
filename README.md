# FoodDiary-Edamam-API


Created a Food search which takes in the name and weight (in grams) of a food item and returns the macros by using Edamam's nutritional analysis API.


features I intend to add:

1. Nutritional Score. This score will be based on the nutriens per gram. As a beginning, the score could go up when protein per gram is high, and it goes down when there is an increased volume of added sugars and saturated fats per gram.

2. IOS app. I intend to make this  app a simple food look-up and log tool. In my opinion, other food diary apps have over-complicated their applications, which lead to apps running really slowly.

3. Meal Search. This feature will allow users to input multiple foods and the weights of these foods at the same time. The macros returned will be combined.
